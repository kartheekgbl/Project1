<h2><center>Why is test data important?</center></h2>
<div>
<p class="ram">
If you're developing an application, you'll want to make sure you're testing it under conditions that closely simulate a production environment. In production, you'll have an army of users banging away at your app and filling your database with data, which puts stress on your code. If you're hand-entering data into a test environment one record at a time using the UI, you're never going to build up the volume and variety of data that your app will accumulate in a few days in production. Worse, the data you enter will be biased toward your own usage patterns and won't match real-world usage, leaving important bugs undiscovered.
